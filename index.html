        <p>
          Hi everyone, I am a fresher at Humber College, and I am currently
          pursuing a diploma in computer programming . I have completed my
          senior-secondary education from Christ King Convent Sr. Sec. School in
          Kapurthala. Apart from that, I have achieved some certifications in
          Basic Python and MS Office. I was born in Kapurthala, a historic city
          nicknamed as the Paris of Punjab in India. I originally come from a
          small village called Waryah Dona where we have a small dairy farm. My
          father is a professional physical education teacher, while my mother
          is a housewife. Apart from that, I am a single child, so I have a
          great bond with my grandparents.
        </p>

        <center><h2>Interests</h2></center>

        <p>
          I have liked playing physical games such as Soccer, Cricket, and
          Volleyball since I was a kid. Moreover, I like to play chess, ludo and
          the mobile game ping pong fury while I'm at home. Furthermore, when it
          comes to fashion , I heavily like the designers Tommy Hillfiger and
          Varsity because of the catchy look that they provide along with
          quality material and well-defined fabric. In conclusion, if we talk
          about role models, Lionel Messi has always been my favorite
          International celebrity and Soccer player. He is my idol and as he is
          getting near to his retirement i would overjoyed if i ever get a
          chance to physically watch him play.
